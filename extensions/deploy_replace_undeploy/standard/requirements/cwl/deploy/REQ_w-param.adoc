label:: /req/cwl/deploy/w-param

part:: If the CWL contains more than a single workflow identifier, an additional `w` query parameter MAY be used to target a specific workflow id to be deployed.

part:: If the `w` parameter has a value, the server SHALL validate the CWL at the request time. In case, the server cannot find the `w` identifier within the workflow from the CWL file provided, a 400 status code is expected and a document based upon exception.yaml with the type "worflow-not-found".
