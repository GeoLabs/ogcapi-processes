part:: If a process can be represented for the intended use as a <<rc_cwl,CWL Application>>, implementations SHOULD consider supporting the <<rc_cwl,CWL>> encoding for describing the process to be deployed to the API.

part:: The media type `application/cwl` SHALL be used to indicate that request body contains a processes description encoded as a <<rc_cwl,CWL Application>>.

part:: If the CWL contains more than one workflow, an additional `w` query parameter MAY be used to reference the workflow id to be deployed.

part:: The server SHOULD validate the CWL at the request time. In case, the server cannot find the `w` identifier within the workflow from the CWL provided, a 400 status code is expected with the type "workflow-not-found".
