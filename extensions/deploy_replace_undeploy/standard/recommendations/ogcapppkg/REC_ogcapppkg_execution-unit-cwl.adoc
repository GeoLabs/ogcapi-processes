label:: /rec/ogcapppkg/execution-unit-cwl

part:: If the execution unit is encoded in CWL then it is recommended that the contents of the execution unit be the properties:
 * `type`  and `href` if passed by reference
 * `value` and `mediaType` if passed by value

part:: If the execution unit is encoded in CWL, the value of the `type` property SHALL be `application/cwl`, when for `mediaType` it should be `application/cwl+json`.

part:: If the execution unit is encoded in CWL, the value of the `href` property SHALL be a reference to the CWL encoded file. The value of the `value` property shall be the CWL encoded in json format.

part:: If the CWL contains more than a single workflow identifier, an addition `w` query parameter MAY be used to target a specific workflow id to be deployed.

part:: The server SHOULD validate the CWL at the request time. In case, the server cannot find the `w` identifier within the workflow from the CWL provided, a 400 status code is expected with the type "cwl-worflow-not-exist".
